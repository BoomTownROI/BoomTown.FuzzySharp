# FuzzySharp


## FuzzyWuzzy C# (DotNet) Implementation

Fuzzy string matching for C# based on [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) Python algorithm. The algorithm uses [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to calculate similarity between strings.

This project is a port of the [JavaWuzzy](https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy) implementation because of the language similarities. 

The FuzzySharp library is a .netstandard 2.0 project. To run the unit tests you will need .netcore 2.0.

Benefits of this project include

* No Dependencies!
* Can be used in full .Net (>4.6.1) or .Net Core (>2.0) applications!
